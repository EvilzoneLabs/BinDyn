# BinDyn
Dynamic Binary Analysis Framework

Requires QT4

To compile CD to the main directory then:

make clean
qmake -project
qmake
make
make clean

After that ./BinDyn & and you're on your own, it's all pretty self explanatory.

Also, I have included a simple template for you to program your own modules.

See the Files: template.header and template.source in this folder?

(named as such to bypass errors thrown by qmake if theres any unused code in the project) 

Go get em tiger.
